📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Sales Performance Analysis
🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Sales Performance Analysis to identify trends, patterns, and factors influencing performance.

It covers:

Data Cleaning (missing values, duplicates, outliers)

Statistical Analysis (mean, median, std, correlations)

Data Visualization (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, scatterplots, time-series)

Predictive Modeling using Linear Regression

🗂️ Datasets

General Dataset (general_dataset.csv)

Columns: Product, Profit, Region, Category, etc.

Used for EDA tasks.

Sales Dataset (sales_data.csv)

Columns: Product, Region, Sales, Profit, Discount, Category, Date

Used for Sales Performance Analysis.

🛠️ Skills & Tools Learned

✔️ Data Cleaning & Wrangling
✔️ Handling Missing Values, Duplicates, and Outliers
✔️ Statistical Analysis (Descriptive Stats & Correlations)
✔️ Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
✔️ Time-Series Analysis using Datetime
✔️ Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression (Scikit-learn)

📈 Key Insights

Strong correlations between Profit, Sales, and Discounts.

Outliers detected in sales/absences using boxplots.

Seasonal sales trends observed using time-series plots.

Predictive model (Linear Regression) provides insights into the effect of Profit & Discount on Sales.

📊 Visualizations

Histograms for distribution analysis

Boxplots for outlier detection

Heatmaps for correlation analysis

Scatter plots for Profit vs Discount

Time-series plots for Sales trends

Bar plots for Sales by Region & Category

🤖 Predictive Model
